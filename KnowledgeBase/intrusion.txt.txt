Network intrusion happens when an attacker tries to gain unauthorized access to systems.

Examples:
- Brute force login attempts
- Port scanning
- Denial of service attacks
- Exploiting vulnerable services

If detected:
1. Block suspicious IP
2. Review logs
3. Reset credentials if needed
4. Monitor future traffic
